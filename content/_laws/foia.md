The [Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA)](/laws/foia/) requires that all agencies publish publicly their policies and procedures. Moreover, it establishes the right of the public to request any records the agency might possess.  There are [exceptions to this](https://www.foia.gov/faq.html#b-a17), for instance agencies do not have to release information if it contains issues of national security, trade secrets, or personal information on individuals. Agencies may charge a reasonable fee for the production of these records, but it may take months - or even years - for these to be returned to the requester. In an agency, these requests are commonly known as **FOIA requests**.

In general, agencies respond to FOIA requests directly back to the requestor. However, for many years many agencies have been pressured by watchdog groups to adopt a "Release to One, Release to All" policy, in which responses to all FOIA requests are made openly available online for the public to review. Although a limited six-month pilot was performed during the Obama administration in 2015, these were not formalized in most agencies.
